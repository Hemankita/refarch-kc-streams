# README 

The file credential.py.zip  was used in an earlier version is not deleted. 

The file credential.example is now  deprecated  and replaced with credential.template.py.

This renaming makes clear that the file: 
 - is a valid python file  (.py) with python assignment statements 
 - is just a template for credentials and contains no active credentials 
 
 The configuration of these credentials is described in refarch-kc- streams in the section on configuring your application.
