# README 

The credential.py is derived from the credential.py.zip. Passing in the 'pwd' on the HUB applications will
expland the file if it's necessary. 

When you update the file credential.py, rebuild the .zip file and check it in. The command to compress:
```bash
$ zip -e credential.py.zip credential.py
```
You'll be prompted for the password to use.
